                <p>I am a licensed attorney in the state of Illinois looking for a change in direction.  I have spent 18 years working at the same firm, talking to clients, and preparing their chapter 7 and 13 personal bankruptcies for court.</p>

                <p>At this time, I am looking to expand my horizons by building a career in web development. I want a career that is creatively fulfilling. I want to learn and master new things.</p>
